- `Smartseq_data_before_pySCENIC.R`: Preprocessing Smart-seq data before running pySCENIC.
- `pySCENIC_downstream_analysis.py`: Downstream analysis and visualization of pySCENIC output.
- `pySCENIC_shell_script.sh`: Shell script for running pySCENIC pipeline components.
- `scATAC_pySCENIC_aNK.Rproj`: RStudio project file.

## üì¶ Requirements

All the required packages in R and dependencies in python have been listed in the scripts
